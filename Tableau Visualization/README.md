## Ask
- What specific metrics and KPIs are most important to the Sales team? (e.g., Sales by region, Sales by product, Year-over-Year growth)
- What time intervals should the data cover? (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, annually)
- Are there any specific comparisons or drill-downs that need to be included? (e.g., comparing sales performance across different regions or product lines)
- Are there any specific design preferences? (e.g., color schemes)
- Who am I making the dashboard for?

## Prepare
Used this [data dictionary](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/sql/sql-server-2008/ms124438(v=sql.100)) to better understand the database

## Process
Used SQL to join relevant tables, exported query results as CSV files and added the CSVs as tables in tableau

## Analyze
Did individual analysis of each KPI and metrics on separate sheets, making use of calculated fields, parameters, filerts set etc.

## Share
Built the [Tableau dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/triumph.ogeh/viz/AdventureworksSalesDashboard_17240278049000/SalesDashboard) taking into consideration the above mentioned requirements

## Findings
- Sales are primarily from the US
- Clothing and Acessories products are driving sales and components products are performing poorly
- Sales/revenue are higher in Q3 and really low in Q1
- Orders and profit are higher in Q4 especially in December
- Adventure works is making the most sales from walk-in customers

## Recommendations
- Given that walk-in customers are driving sales, consider expanding physical retail presence or enhancing the in-store experience to capitalize on this trend.
- Similarly, if online sales are underperforming, suggest strategies to boost this channel, such as online promotions, improving the e-commerce platform, or optimizing digital marketing.
- Explore opportunities to bundle top-selling products with underperforming ones to drive sales across the portfolio.

## Future Improvements
- Segment customers by demographics, purchasing behavior, or geographic location to identify high-value segments versus low-value segments.
- Analyze  profit margins by product or region to identify where margins are being squeezed or where there is room for improvement.
- Trends in cost of goods sold (COGS) and its impact on profit margins.
- Analyze churn rate of customersâ€”how many customers are leaving versus being retained year over year.
