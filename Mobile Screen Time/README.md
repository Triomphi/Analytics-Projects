Using the six steps of the data analysis process (ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act), this project explores data in an aspect of everyday life.   
I explored time spent on my mobile phone over 3 weeks by collecting data from my phone's Digital Wellbeing App.

**Objective**    
To spend at most 5 hours on mobile screen time per day.

**Questions to consider:**
What activities make me use my mobile phone regularly?
What activities would make me spend less time on my mobile phone?

**Data Collected**
- **Date:** The date the data was collected
- **Screen Time:** Time spent on screen for a full day
- **Phone Unlocks:** Number of phone unlocks in a day
- **Notifications:** Number of notifications received in a day
- **Screen time of 23 Apps:** Time spent on each app in a day
