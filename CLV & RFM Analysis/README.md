## 1. Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) with Cohort Analysis
This project explores Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) and cohort-based revenue trends using event-level user data. It includes both a traditional CLV calculation and a refined 12-week cohort analysis to provide deeper insights into customer behavior and marketing sustainability.

Key Objectives:

- Calculate Average Order Value (AOV), Purchase Frequency, Customer Value (CV), and traditional CLV
- Evaluate if CLV justifies the $2 customer acquisition cost
- Conduct a 12-week cohort analysis including all website visitors (not just purchasers)
- Track cumulative Average Revenue per User (ARPU) across cohorts
- Predict future CLV using average cumulative growth rates

Tools & Skills:
SQL · Cohort Analysis · CLV Modeling · Data Visualization · Forecasting · Customer Analytics

## 2. RFM Analysis & Customer Segmentation Project
This project focuses on performing RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis to identify customer segments and recommend actionable marketing strategies.

Key Objectives:
- Use one year of transaction data (2010-12-01 to 2011-12-01) for analysis
- Calculate Recency (from 2011-12-01), Frequency, and Monetary value using SQL in BigQuery
- Assign R, F, and M scores (1 to 4) based on quartiles using APPROX_QUANTILES()
- Compute an overall RFM score and segment customers into key groups: Best Customers, Loyal Customers, Big Spenders, Lost Customers

Also, build a dashboard in Tableau to visualize segment distribution and behavior and share insights and strategic recommendations for marketing focus based on customer value
