**Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) with Cohort Analysis**
This project explores Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) and cohort-based revenue trends using event-level user data. It includes both a traditional CLV calculation and a refined 12-week cohort analysis to provide deeper insights into customer behavior and marketing sustainability.

Key Objectives:

- Calculate Average Order Value (AOV), Purchase Frequency, Customer Value (CV), and traditional CLV
- Evaluate if CLV justifies the $2 customer acquisition cost
- Conduct a 12-week cohort analysis including all website visitors (not just purchasers)
- Track cumulative Average Revenue per User (ARPU) across cohorts
- Predict future CLV using average cumulative growth rates

Tools & Skills:
