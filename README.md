# Analytics-Projects
This repository contains some of the projects done during my Data Analytics Course at Turing College

1. **A/B Testing:**  A fast-food chain plans to add a new item to its menu. However, they are still undecided between three possible marketing campaigns for promoting the new product. In order to determine which promotion has the greatest effect on sales, the new item is introduced at locations in several randomly selected markets. A different promotion is used at each location, and the weekly sales of the new item are recorded for the first four weeks. **This project evaluates A/B testing results and decide which marketing strategy works the best**, using the Fast Food Marketing Campaign dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chebotinaa/fast-food-marketing-campaign-ab-test).  
  
2. **Advanced SQL:** These set of queries explore the [Adventureworks 2005 database](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-Qsnn3bg0_PYgY5kKJOUDG8xdKLvOLPK/view) to give an overvew of the customers at this company and report slaes numbers. This projects tests understanding of Advanced SQL concepts.  
  
3. **CLV & RFM Analysis:** This project explores Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) and cohort-based revenue trends using event-level user data. It includes both a traditional CLV calculation and a refined 12-week cohort analysis to provide deeper insights into customer behavior and marketing sustainability.
  
4. **Coronary Heart Disease Risk:** The primary objective of this project is to develop a predictive model to assess the 10-year risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) in individuals based on a combination of demographic, behavioral, and medical factors. The dataset can be found on [Kaggle]()
  
5. **Coursera Enrollments:** This project uses pandas to perfom Exploratory Data Analysis in order to understand what factors influence student enrollment in Coursera courses. The dataset used is available on [Kaggle]()  
  
6. **Mobile Screen Time:** Using the six steps of the data analysis process (ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act), this project explores data in an aspect of everyday life. I explored time spent on my mobile phone.  
  
7. **Spotify Top Tracks:** Using the [Spotify Top 50 Tracks of 2020 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/atillacolak/top-50-spotify-tracks-2020) I analyze Spotify's top hits and quantify what makes a hit song on Spotify.
  
8. **Tableau Visualization:** Exploring the Adventureworks Database, this project provides an interactive Tableau dashboard that shows useful information to the sales department at this company. The Dashboard can be founf [here]()   
  
9. **Weekly Subscription Churn:** This project provides a weekly subscriptions data that shows how many subscribers started their subscription in a particular week and how many remain active in the following 6 weeks.
